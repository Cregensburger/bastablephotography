This is a basic site for Mary Bastable. She desired a simple and clean layout that was easily navigated. 

Below is a wishlist described by the client: 

​- Overall would like a classy/clean look. Something such as:
	http://www.steffenallen.com
	http://cobrienphoto.com
	http://www.marclabrie.co​m​

- If there is a kids/child photography section then use the name "Merry Bee Photography" - I think I still have the domain name. It can be more whimsical - golden yellows/blacks/grays. The rest of the website should be more adult-ish though.

- Colors: wanted, something clean.

- Links to facebook, twitter and so on: I don't have professional ones yet. Once I have created them I will send you the link.

- Deals: Probably should have some sort of rates/packages page. I will try to come up with something

Update(Sept. 3, 2015): 
1. The MVP of the site is finished. Currently working on cleaning up the site, but basic functionality is complete.

2. Client opted to change the name to "MerryBee Kids." After seeing how the page looked with different colors and style, she wanted it changed back so that the style was the same throughout the page. 

3. Colors have been approved out of a selection of palettes. Implemented, but subject to change upon further feature updates. 

4. Waiting on links to be provided. Placeholder links to specific pages used instead. ETA unknown.

5. Waiting on package deals to be provided. ETA unknown.
